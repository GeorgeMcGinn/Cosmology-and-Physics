**Conversation Summary for Continuation:**

**Project Context:**
Working on "Planetary Impact Physics Simulator" - a scientific toolkit with two main programs:
- `unbindEnergy`: Calculates impactor requirements to overcome planetary gravitational binding energy
- `unbindDose`: Models radiation exposure from high-energy impact events

**Language Conversions Completed:**
- Converted C programs to Python (successful)
- Converted C programs to QB64 (with several challenges resolved):
  - Fixed case-insensitive variable naming conflicts (F/f became different descriptive names)
  - Resolved scientific notation display (`^^^^` format showing "D+XX" for double precision)
  - Fixed command-line parsing for object names with spaces in QB64
  - Implemented custom argument parsing and numeric validation functions

**Documentation Created:**
- Complete README.md for subdirectory with installation requirements, usage examples
- MIT License file
- Main repository README.md section using blockquote indentation
- Addressed installation instructions for multiple platforms (avoiding distro-specific package managers)

**Physics Discussions:**
- Clarified difference between classical (impossible >c speeds) vs relativistic (approaches c) calculations
- Calculated Moon destruction scenario: binding energy ~1.2*10²⁹ J (vs Earth's 2.49*10³² J)
- **Critical finding**: Even Moon destruction produces lethal radiation doses (~1.9 million Gy at Earth distance)

**Recent Atmospheric Updates:**
- Added 8th optional parameter `atmos_trans` to unbindDose.c (defaults to 1.0 = vacuum)
- Usage: `./unbindDose [E] [eta] [d] [A] [M] [f] [theta_deg] [atmos_trans]`
- Simple transmission factor: 1.0 = no attenuation, 0.1 = 90% atmospheric absorption
- Updated documentation to reflect basic atmospheric modeling

**Atmospheric Complexity Discussion:**
Current simple factor doesn't account for: energy-dependent absorption, radiation type differences, angle-dependent path length, secondary radiation production, spectral hardening, altitude variations, or chemical interactions. These effects are calculable but would require ~100-200 lines additional code for maybe 95% accuracy vs current 80% accuracy. Trade-off between simplicity and precision identified but not yet implemented.

**Current Status:** 
Programs working with basic atmospheric attenuation. Started to implement more sophisticated atmospheric modeling (energy-dependent effects, etc.)but development not working properly.
